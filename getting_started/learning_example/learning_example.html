<p>We consider the classic portfolio management problem where we select a portfolio <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \in \reals^n\)</span> of stocks to maximize returns. Our selected stock should not deviate too far from our previous holdings, denoted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^{\text{prev}} \in \reals^n\)</span>. The trading cost of the total deviations is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.2\|x - x^{\text{prev}}\|_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We model returns as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>, and thus the objective to minimize is</p>
