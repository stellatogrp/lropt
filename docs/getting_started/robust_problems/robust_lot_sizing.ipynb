    "The Lot Sizing problem is a fundamental optimization challenge in operations management, focusing on finding the best quantities to produce or order in each period to meet demand while minimizing costs. Over a fixed planning horizon, the problem involves known product demand and associated costs like setup, production, inventory holding, and backorders. Key decisions include determining production quantities and initiation timings. The primary goal is to devise a production plan that efficiently meets demand each period. In its robust form, the problem considers uncertain production yields, fluctuating within a range defined by its nominal value and maximum deviation."

    "In this example, we aim to solve the Robust LSP provided in Robust optimization for lot-sizing problems under yield uncertainty (paula metzker, simon thevenin). Let us consider a single - item multi period uncapacitated LSP with backorder and production yield determines the quantity to produce in each period of the finite planning horizon $T$. We are given the setup cost $\\vec{s}$, the inventory holding cost $\\vec{h}$, the backorder cost $\\vec{b}$ and the demand $\\vec{d}$ for each time period in $T$. The model contains the decision variables $X_t$, the lot size to be produced, and the setup decision $Y_t$. The strictly positive uncertain production yield is defined as $\\bar{p}$. "
