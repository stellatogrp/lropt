    "The Facility Location Problem (FLP) is a fundamental optimization challenge focusing on determining the optimal locations for facilities such as warehouses, plants, or distribution centers to minimize costs or maximize service coverage. It involves deciding where to place these facilities to efficiently serve demands from customers or locations, considering factors like transportation costs, facility setup costs, and capacity constraints. The goal of the facility location problem is to find the best allocation that satisfies demands and maxinimize profits."

Let $\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}_+ $ be the unit price of goods. Let $c_{i}, C_{i} ,K_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}_+ $ be the unit cost of production, cost of capacity and the cost of opening a location at facility $i$ respectively. Let $d_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}_+ $ be the cost of shipping from location $i$ to location $j$. Let $D_{j\\tau} $ be the demand for period $\\tau$ at location $j$. Decision variable $x_{ij\\tau}$ represents the proportion of the demand at location $j$ during period $\\tau$ that is satisfied by facility $i$. $P_{i\\tau}$ represents the amount of good that is produced at facility $i$ during the period $\\tau$. For each facility $i$, the decision variable $I_i$ denotes whether the facility in location $i $ is open or closed, by taking values 1 or 0, respectively, and $Z_i$ denotes the capacity of the facility in this location in case it is open. $M$ is a large constant.\n"
