    "The Facility Location Problem (FLP) is a fundamental optimization challenge focusing on determining the optimal locations for facilities such as warehouses, plants, or distribution centers to minimize costs or maximize service coverage. It involves deciding where to place these facilities to efficiently serve demands from customers or locations, considering factors like transportation costs, facility setup costs, and capacity constraints. The goal of the facility location problem is to find the best allocation that satisfies demands and maxinimize profits."
